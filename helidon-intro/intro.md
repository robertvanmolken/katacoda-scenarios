# Welcome to your the Project Helidon scenario!

In this scenario you will learn how to reactively program microservices that run on a fast web core using project Helidon. Since Helidon is just a collection of libraries running on a fast Netty core, there is no extra overhead or bloat.

## Reactive WebServer

Microservice build with Helidon run on their Reactive WebServer providing a modern functional programming model and runs on top of Netty. As its lightweight, flexible and reactive, the Helidon WebServer provides a simple to use and fast foundation for your microservices.

## MicroProfile Support

Helidon supports MicroProfile and provides familiar APIs like JAX-RS, CDI and JSON-P/B. Their MicroProfile implementation runs on the same fast Helidon Reactive WebServer. 

## Observable and Resilient
Helidon supports health checks, metrics, tracing and fault tolerance and easily integrates with Prometheus, Zipkin and Kubernetes.

## Environment
The available environment includes the following software tools: 
`Docker`, `OpenJDK`, `Maven`, `Docker`, `Kubectl`, and `Eclipse Ch√© (browser IDE)`
